# RAG-PDF-QA: Retrieval-Augmented Generation over PDFs

**Description:**  
This project demonstrates an end-to-end **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** workflow using PDFs as the source documents.  
It combines **document ingestion**, **embedding generation**, **vector retrieval**, and **LLM-based answer generation**.  
This is highly relevant for research roles involving **LLMs, RAG pipelines, APIs**, and **knowledge-oriented AI systems**.
